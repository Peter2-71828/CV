<h1> Peter Dean </h1>

<h2> Profile </h2>
  I am a driven developer passionate to expand my knowledge and explore the tech industry. I have always been motivated by a desire to understand the world and build things using that knowledge. Having been exposed to programming building a 3D printer and through my studies in aerospace engineering I knew I had to take the plunge into the world of software. I attended Makers academy and have never looked back. <p>

  As well as studying engineering I am a diving instructor. Diving has resulted in me gaining many skills including having an eye for detail, being good at lateral thinking and loving teaching and knowledge sharing to name a few.
